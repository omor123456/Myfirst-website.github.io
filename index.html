        <p><center> Anyone who uses a computer connected to the
             internet has a risk of getting hacked by a 
             hacker. First of all, we need to know about
              how hackers get the info from us. A hacker
               might reach out to us by sending spam emails,
                calling from an unknown number, or simply 
                clinking to an unusual link/downloading files 
                (which can contain some type of virus or malware.
                 After that, computer hackers can also 
                try to access your computer and private information directly
                 if you are not protected by a firewall. By doing this, they 
                can monitor our personal data. </center>
